# High-Throughput Screening of Hypothetical Metal-Organic Frameworks for Thermal Conductivity 

This repository contains 10,194 hypothetical MOF structures in a CIF file format that were generated using the ToBaCCo-3.0 code. These MOFs were used to derive structure-property relationships governing MOFs and thermal transport.  

You need to clone the repo to access all 10,194 MOF structures
